          <h1 class="alvi-text" >Tamzeed Rahman</h1>
         <p class="alvi-text">I'm a full-stack developer studying at Pursuit, an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. Proficient in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node, PostgreSQL, Redux.js, React.js, Git, and Github.
          My passion for improving tomorrow's technology was sparked by my first computer build from scratch, which led me to look for the next challenge. I eventually created my own projects and assembled circuitry hardware, created ad blockers with raspberry pi, and created bad-USB mods with ducky scripting language. This ability to pursue my passions resulting in a tangible final product keeps me learning and creating. I'm currently making artisan keycaps and keyboards.
          For the future, I look forward to working on something that challenges me and constantly keeps me on my mental toes. Just like how one's body needs exercise to live a long fulfilling life, I believe that mental exercise is also important. In the work setting, people describe me as dedicated, reliable, and results-driven.</p>
